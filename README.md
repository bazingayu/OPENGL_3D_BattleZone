3D Game with C++ + OPENGL, showcase my C++ programming skills and OPENGL ability. The code is well designed with OOP. 

##Features:  
1. Display at least one 3D polygon mesh - you may generate this or load scene/objects from a file;   
2. Allow interactive manipulation of part of the 3D scene (i.e. transforms) using keyboard/mouse or some other device;   
3. Include at least one complex object with a hierarchical structure undergoing transformations;   
4. The scene must be lit and shaded; including diffuse and specular objects;
5. Support at least two different camera views, e.g.,   
   a) first person view with camera movements allowing user to walk or fly through the scene; b) top down view (e.g. overhead map)
